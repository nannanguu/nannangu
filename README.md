## Projects

### CNC Wind Tunnel Testing Platform
- Independently developed a lightweight, CNC-controlled platform for aerodynamic testing  
- Enabled automated linear and angular adjustment of test objects in airflow using stepper motors  
- Designed for seamless integration with UCSBâ€™s wind tunnel, ensuring vibration resistance and minimal flow interference  
- Built custom control interface for repeatable test sequences

### Oceallus â€“ Underwater Camera System
- Participated the development of a modular camera system for long-term underwater deployment at 30 meters  
- Implemented infrared lighting control and low-power imaging using Raspberry Pi Zero and photoresistor-triggered logic  
- Constructed a tripod frame with adjustable ballast and 3D-printed ABS joints for field deployment on the seafloor  
- Performed system integration, pressure testing, and documentation to support reproducibility by other research teams  
- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Oceallus/underwater_spy_camera)

### FlexBin â€“ Smart Trash Compression System
- Designed and built a smart trash can with a dual-wall compression mechanism for easier bag removal  
- Integrated load cells, IR remote, and LED indicators to automate user interaction  
- Programmed control logic and coordinated team progress through all prototyping phases  

### VibraWake â€“ Silent Wake-Up Pillow
- Created a quiet vibrating alarm pillow with adjustable motor intensity using Arduino  
- Prototyped and tested internal cushioning and damping for comfort and effectiveness in different use scenarios
